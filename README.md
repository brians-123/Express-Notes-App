## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

This project allows for note creation deletion and storage on heroku. The app is hosted [here](https://express-notes-app.herokuapp.com/) and a video of the functionality is hosted [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SJzIqJFbCkI2_2yNmWMhODYg0nK_VyUw/view).

The note taking app will update a json file with each note created or deleted. When someone comes back to the app, their prior notes will be present. It is the first application I created using server side logic.

The application uses the following technologies:

- express
- heroku
- fs module
- javascript
- jquery
- html
- bootstrap
